## Things I did 

- Used [Material UI (MUI)](https://mui.com/) as my style library because I am familiar with it so saved on time there versus building out custom components or looking into other design libraries and learning their specificities. It also is pretty accessible so that saves tons of time vs if I were to implement custom components and have to make them completely accessible.
- Used the `sx` prop MUI provides for times sake instead of creating separate style files.
- I made it so you can only add an item to the cart once for the sake of time, but would've utilized the quantity field and allowed the user to choose a quantity of the item they would've liked to add to the cart.

## Things I left out because of time

- Tests
- Sass modules (my preferred way of styling)
  - instead used the `sx` prop
- 'Prettier' keyboard navigation
  - left most of the default keyboard navigation MUI provides for time.
- I would've liked to do more with the categories and make tags for them.
- Did not utilize all the fields in the data that were given. Chose to only display the most important ones from my perspective.
- States:
  - Would have made 'better' (more informative and better designed) states for loading, error and empty.
- Would have made the shopping cart more complex and informative to the user.
- Add animations to the card flipping to the description side and other animations.
